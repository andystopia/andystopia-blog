  Documenting and storing 
  information for Nix.

Nix is a language, package manager, and an OS. I have taken the 
time to learn how to harness Nix's power; however, it is a 
quite involved system, so I intend this section of my blog 
to be more a notebook style place to gather experiences when 
working with Nix.
